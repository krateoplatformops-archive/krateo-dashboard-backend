# Catalog Backend Module for Microsoft Graph

This is an extension module to the `plugin-catalog-backend` plugin, providing a
`MicrosoftGraphOrgReaderProcessor` and a `MicrosoftGraphOrgEntityProvider` that
can be used to ingest organization data from the Microsoft Graph API. This
processor is useful if you want to import users and groups from Azure Active
Directory or Office 365.

## Getting Started

First you need to decide whether you want to use an [entity provider or a processor](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/life-of-an-entity#stitching) to ingest the organization data.
If you want groups and users deleted from the source to be automatically deleted
from Backstage, choose the entity provider.

1. Create or use an existing App registration in the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   The App registration requires at least the API permissions `Group.Read.All`,
   `GroupMember.Read.All`, `User.Read` and `User.Read.All` for Microsoft Graph
   (if you still run into errors about insufficient privileges, add
   `Team.ReadBasic.All` and `TeamMember.Read.All` too).

2. Configure the processor or entity provider:

```yaml
# app-config.yaml
catalog:
  processors:
    microsoftGraphOrg:
      providers:
        - target: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0
          authority: https://login.microsoftonline.com
          # If you don't know you tenantId, you can use Microsoft Graph Explorer
          # to query it
          tenantId: ${MICROSOFT_GRAPH_TENANT_ID}
          # Client Id and Secret can be created under Certificates & secrets in
          # the App registration in the Microsoft Azure Portal.
          clientId: ${MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID}
          clientSecret: ${MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET_TOKEN}
          # Optional filter for user, see Microsoft Graph API for the syntax
          # See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties
          # and for the syntax https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters#filter-parameter
          # This and userGroupMemberFilter are mutually exclusive, only one can be specified
          userFilter: accountEnabled eq true and userType eq 'member'
          # Optional filter for users, use group membership to get users.
          # This and userFilter are mutually exclusive, only one can be specified
          userGroupMemberFilter: "displayName eq 'Backstage Users'"
          # Optional filter for group, see Microsoft Graph API for the syntax
          # See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties
          groupFilter: securityEnabled eq false and mailEnabled eq true and groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')
```

`userFilter` and `userGroupMemberFilter` are mutually exclusive, only one can be provided. If both are provided, an error will be thrown.

By default, all users are loaded. If you want to filter users based on their attributes, use `userFilter`. `userGroupMemberFilter` can be used if you want to load users based on their group membership.

3. The package is not installed by default, therefore you have to add a
   dependency to `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph` to your
   backend package.

```bash
# From your Backstage root directory
cd packages/backend
yarn add @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-msgraph
```

### Using the Entity Provider

4. The `MicrosoftGraphOrgEntityProvider` is not registered by default, so you
   have to register it in the catalog plugin. Pass the target to reference a
   provider from the configuration. As entity providers are not part of the
   entity refresh loop, you have to run them manually.

```typescript
// packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts
const msGraphOrgEntityProvider = MicrosoftGraphOrgEntityProvider.fromConfig(
  env.config,
  {
    id: 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0',
    target: 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0',
    logger: env.logger,
  },
);
builder.addEntityProvider(msGraphOrgEntityProvider);

// Trigger a read every 5 minutes
useHotCleanup(
  module,
  runPeriodically(() => msGraphOrgEntityProvider.read(), 5 * 60 * 1000),
);
```

### Using the Processor

4. The `MicrosoftGraphOrgReaderProcessor` is not registered by default, so you
   have to register it in the catalog plugin:

```typescript
// packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts
builder.addProcessor(
  MicrosoftGraphOrgReaderProcessor.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
  }),
);
```

5. Add a location that ingests from Microsoft Graph:

```yaml
# app-config.yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    - type: microsoft-graph-org
      target: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0
      # If you catalog doesn't allow to import Group and User entities by
      # default, allow them here
      rules:
        - allow: [Group, User]
    â€¦
```

## Customize the Processor or Entity Provider

In case you want to customize the ingested entities, both the `MicrosoftGraphOrgReaderProcessor`
and the `MicrosoftGraphOrgEntityProvider` allows to pass transformers for users,
groups and the organization.

1. Create a transformer:

```ts
export async function myGroupTransformer(
  group: MicrosoftGraph.Group,
  groupPhoto?: string,
): Promise<GroupEntity | undefined> {
  if (
    (
      group as unknown as {
        creationOptions: string[];
      }
    ).creationOptions.includes('ProvisionGroupHomepage')
  ) {
    return undefined;
  }

  // Transformations may change namespace, change entity naming pattern, fill
  // profile with more or other details...

  // Create the group entity on your own, or wrap the default transformer
  return await defaultGroupTransformer(group, groupPhoto);
}
```

2. Configure the processor with the transformer:

```ts
builder.addProcessor(
  MicrosoftGraphOrgReaderProcessor.fromConfig(config, {
    logger,
    groupTransformer: myGroupTransformer,
  }),
);
```
