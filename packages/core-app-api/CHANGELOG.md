# @backstage/core-app-api

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- bb2bb36651: **BREAKING**: Removed the deprecated `get` method from `StorageAPI` and its implementations, this method has been replaced by the `snapshot` method. The return value from snapshot no longer includes `newValue` which has been replaced by `value`. For getting notified when a value changes, use `observe# @backstage/core-app-api.
- f3cce3dcf7: **BREAKING**: Removed export of `GithubSession` and `SamlSession` which are only used internally.
- af5eaa87f4: **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated `auth0AuthApiRef`, `oauth2ApiRef`, `samlAuthApiRef` and `oidcAuthApiRef` as these APIs are too generic to be useful. Instructions for how to migrate can be found at [https://backstage.io/docs/api/deprecations#generic-auth-api-refs](https://backstage.io/docs/api/deprecations#generic-auth-api-refs).
- dbf84eee55: **BREAKING**: Removed the deprecated `GithubAuth.normalizeScopes` method.

### Patch Changes

- 40775bd263: Switched out the `GithubAuth` implementation to use the common `OAuth2` implementation. This relies on the simultaneous change in `@backstage/plugin-auth-backend` that enabled access token storage in cookies rather than the current solution that's based on `LocalStorage`.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f959c22787: Asynchronous methods on the identity API can now reliably be called at any time, including early in the bootstrap process or prior to successful sign-in.

  Previously in such situations, a `Tried to access IdentityApi before app was loaded` error would be thrown. Now, those methods will wait and resolve eventually (as soon as a concrete identity API is provided).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ceebe25391: Removed deprecated `SignInResult` type, which was replaced with the new `onSignInSuccess` callback.

### Patch Changes

- fb565073ec: Add an `allowUrl` callback option to `FetchMiddlewares.injectIdentityAuth`
- f050eec2c0: Added validation during the application startup that detects if there are any plugins present that have not had their required external routes bound. Failing the validation will cause a hard crash as it is a programmer error. It lets you detect early on that there are dangling routes, rather than having them cause an error later on.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a036b65c2f: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The app `SignInPage` component has been updated to switch out the `onResult` callback for a new `onSignInSuccess` callback. This is an immediate breaking change without any deprecation period, as it was deemed to be the way of making this change that had the lowest impact.

  The new `onSignInSuccess` callback directly accepts an implementation of an `IdentityApi`, rather than a `SignInResult`. The `SignInPage` from `@backstage/core-component` has been updated to fit this new API, and as long as you pass on `props` directly you should not see any breakage.

  However, if you implement your own custom `SignInPage`, then this will be a breaking change and you need to migrate over to using the new callback. While doing so you can take advantage of the `UserIdentity.fromLegacy` helper from `@backstage/core-components` to make the migration simpler by still using the `SignInResult` type. This helper is also deprecated though and is only provided for immediate migration. Long-term it will be necessary to build the `IdentityApi` using for example `UserIdentity.create` instead.

  The following is an example of how you can migrate existing usage immediately using `UserIdentity.fromLegacy`:

  ```ts
  onResult(signInResult);
  // becomes
  onSignInSuccess(UserIdentity.fromLegacy(signInResult));
  ```

  The following is an example of how implement the new `onSignInSuccess` callback of the `SignInPage` using `UserIdentity.create`:

  ```ts
  const identityResponse = await authApi.getBackstageIdentity();
  // Profile is optional and will be removed, but allows the
  // synchronous getProfile method of the IdentityApi to be used.
  const profile = await authApi.getProfile();
  onSignInSuccess(
    UserIdentity.create({
      identity: identityResponse.identity,
      authApi,
      profile,
    }),
  );
  ```

## 0.1.24

### Patch Changes

- 0e7f256034: Fixed a bug where `useRouteRef` would fail in situations where relative navigation was needed and the app was is mounted on a sub-path. This would typically show up as a failure to navigate to a tab on an entity page.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/core-components@0.7.6
  - @backstage/theme@0.2.14
  - @backstage/core-plugin-api@0.2.2

## 0.1.23

### Patch Changes

- bab752e2b3: Change default port of backend from 7000 to 7007.

  This is due to the AirPlay Receiver process occupying port 7000 and preventing local Backstage instances on MacOS to start.

  You can change the port back to 7000 or any other value by providing an `app-config.yaml` with the following values:

  ```
  backend:
    listen: 0.0.0.0:7123
    baseUrl: http://localhost:7123
  ```

  More information can be found here: https://backstage.io/docs/conf/writing

- 000190de69: The `ApiRegistry` from `@backstage/core-app-api` class has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. To replace it, we have introduced two new helpers that are exported from `@backstage/test-utils`, namely `TestApiProvider` and `TestApiRegistry`.

  These two new helpers are more tailored for writing tests and development setups, as they allow for partial implementations of each of the APIs.

  When migrating existing code it is typically best to prefer usage of `TestApiProvider` when possible, so for example the following code:

  ```tsx
  render(
    <ApiProvider
      apis={ApiRegistry.from([
        [identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi as unknown as IdentityApi]
      ])}
    >
      {...}
    </ApiProvider>
  )
  ```

  Would be migrated to this:

  ```tsx
  render(
    <TestApiProvider apis={[[identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi]]}>
      {...}
    </TestApiProvider>
  )
  ```

  In cases where the `ApiProvider` is used in a more standalone way, for example to reuse a set of APIs across multiple tests, the `TestApiRegistry` can be used instead. Note that the `TestApiRegistry` only has a single static factory method, `.from()`, and it is slightly different from the existing `.from()` method on `ApiRegistry` in that it doesn't require the API pairs to be wrapped in an outer array.

  Usage that looks like this:

  ```ts
  const apis = ApiRegistry.with(
    identityApiRef,
    mockIdentityApi as unknown as IdentityApi,
  ).with(configApiRef, new ConfigReader({}));
  ```

  OR like this:

  ```ts
  const apis = ApiRegistry.from([
    [identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi as unknown as IdentityApi],
    [configApiRef, new ConfigReader({})],
  ]);
  ```

  Would be migrated to this:

  ```ts
  const apis = TestApiRegistry.from(
    [identityApiRef, mockIdentityApi],
    [configApiRef, new ConfigReader({})],
  );
  ```

  If your app is still using the `ApiRegistry` to construct the `apis` for `createApp`, we recommend that you move over to use the new method of supplying API factories instead, using `createApiFactory`.

## 0.1.22

### Patch Changes

- Reverted the `createApp` TypeScript type to match the one before version `0.1.21`, as it was an accidental breaking change.

## 0.1.21

### Patch Changes

- 0b1de52732: Migrated to using new `ErrorApiError` and `ErrorApiErrorContext` names.
- ecd1fcb80a: Deprecated the `BackstagePluginWithAnyOutput` type.
- 32bfbafb0f: Start exporting and marking several types as public to address errors in the API report.
- 014cbf8cb9: The `createApp` function from `@backstage/core-app-api` has been deprecated, with two new options being provided as a replacement.

  The first and most commonly used one is `createApp` from the new `@backstage/app-defaults` package, which behaves just like the existing `createApp`. In the future this method is likely to be expanded to add more APIs and other pieces into the default setup, for example the Utility APIs from `@backstage/integration-react`.

  The other option that we now provide is to use `createSpecializedApp` from `@backstage/core-app-api`. This is a more low-level API where you need to provide a full set of options, including your own `components`, `icons`, `defaultApis`, and `themes`. The `createSpecializedApp` way of creating an app is particularly useful if you are not using `@backstage/core-components` or MUI, as it allows you to avoid those dependencies completely.

## 0.1.16

### Patch Changes

- d9fd798cc8: The Core App API now automatically instruments all route location changes using
  the new Analytics API. Each location change triggers a `navigate` event, which
  is an analogue of a "pageview" event in traditional web analytics systems. In
  addition to the path, these events provide plugin-level metadata via the
  analytics context, which can be useful for analyzing plugin usage:

  ```json
  {
    "action": "navigate",
    "subject": "/the-path/navigated/to?with=params#and-hashes",
    "context": {
      "extension": "App",
      "pluginId": "id-of-plugin-that-exported-the-route",
      "routeRef": "associated-route-ref-id"
    }
  }
  ```

  These events can be identified and handled by checking for the action
  `navigate` and the extension `App`.

### Patch Changes

- cfcb486aa: Add system icons for the built-in entity types and use them in the entity list of the `catalog-import` plugin.
- 392b36fa1: Added support for using authenticating via GitHub Apps in addition to GitHub OAuth Apps. It used to be possible to use GitHub Apps, but they did not handle session refresh correctly.

  Note that GitHub Apps handle OAuth scope at the app installation level, meaning that the `scope` parameter for `getAccessToken` has no effect. When calling `getAccessToken` in open source plugins, one should still include the appropriate scope, but also document in the plugin README what scopes are required in the case of GitHub Apps.

  In addition, the `authHandler` and `signInResolver` options have been implemented for the GitHub provider in the auth backend.

### Patch Changes

- 9bca2a252: Fixes a type bug where supplying all app icons to `createApp` was required, rather than just a partial list.
- 75b8537ce: This change adds automatic error boundaries around extensions.

  This means that all exposed parts of a plugin are wrapped in a general error boundary component, that is plugin aware. The default design for the error box is borrowed from `@backstage/errors`. To override the default "fallback", one must provide a component named `ErrorBoundaryFallback` to `createApp`, like so:

  ```ts
  const app = createApp({
    components: {
      ErrorBoundaryFallback: props => {
        // a custom fallback component
        return (
          <>
            <h1>Oops.</h1>
            <h2>
              The plugin {props.plugin.getId()} failed with{' '}
              {props.error.message}
            </h2>
            <button onClick={props.resetError}>Try again</button>
          </>
        );
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  The props here include:

  - `error`. An `Error` object or something that inherits it that represents the error that was thrown from any inner component.
  - `resetError`. A callback that will simply attempt to mount the children of the error boundary again.
  - `plugin`. A `BackstagePlugin` that can be used to look up info to be presented in the error message. For instance, you may want to keep a map of your internal plugins and team names or slack channels and present these when an error occurs. Typically, you'll do that by getting the plugin ID with `plugin.getId()`.

- da8cba44f: Deprecate and disable the extension creation methods, which were added to this package by mistake and should only exist within `@backstage/core-plugin-api`.
